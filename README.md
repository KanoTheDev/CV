Web development
---------------

I'm convinced that great software transforms our lives. 
For many years I felt I want to become a software
developer and I made a radical change in 2014.
I moved from Kaunas, Lithuania to London, UK and
started a 12 weeks object oriented programming and 
software design course on Makers Academy. 
MA made me more confident in 
planning and writing sofware. It feels like it was
one of the best decisions I made in my life.

Currently I am looking for projects and positions in London where I can continue to challenge and stretch myself.
