Web development
---------------

I'm convinced that great software transforms our lives. 
For many years I felt I want to become a software
developer and I made a radical change this year. 
I moved from Kaunas, Lithuania to London, UK and
started a 12 weeks object oriented programming and 
software design course on Makers Academy. 
It feels like it was one of the best decisions
I made in my life.
Now I am more confident in planning and writing sofware.
